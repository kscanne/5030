Please Read Before Reviewing :)

Hi Dear Reviewer:

- IMPORTANT: The main code to review is in the file 'process.js', which is located in the 'assets' folder.
    -This file contains the main logic to convert a word to lower case

- However, this is a JavaScript application that runs from an HTML page
- To run the application, please open the 'index.html' file in Google Chrome or Firefox
- You can see the test results in the browser as soon as you open the 'index.html' file
- You can also see an example of the test results at the bottom of the 'tests.js' file, which is located in the assets folder

- What files are in the app?
    -Assets/
        - form-handler.js -> This is to handle reload in the HTML form element
        - languages-list.js -> This is where we store the languages array
        - populate-options.js -> Creates the language options in the dropdown so user can select it
        - process.js -> MAIN logic of the lower case
        - style.css -> Design stylesheet
        - tests.js -> Logic to run the tests
    - index.html -> main index of the application
    - README -> Helpful information to know
    - tests.tsv -> Raw test data


-How were the test results?
