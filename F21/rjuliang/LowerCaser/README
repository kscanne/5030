Please Read Before Reviewing :)

Your program for the code review lab goes in this directory

Hi Dear Reviewer:

- IMPORTANT: The main code to review is in the file 'process.js', which is located in the 'assets' folder.
    -This file contains the main logic to convert a word to lower case

- This is an JavaScript application that runs from an HTML page
- To run the application, please open the 'index.html' file in Google Chrome or Firefox
- You can see the test results in the browser as soon as you open the 'index.html' file
- You can also see an example of the test results at the bottom of the 'tests.js' file, which is located in the assets folder

- What files are in the app?
